The dataset was constructed by scrapping an API endpoint that given a venue, it lists the next top 5 venues where users usually check-in afterwards. All the data is aggregated, and the specifics of each trip, or check-in sequence are not available. However, it can provide a good overview of some general dynamics around the city. \n",
