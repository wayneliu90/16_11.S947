    "# Git Crash Course: Setting up Git and Github (Command Line) \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration is key when working with a group on a coding project. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with Github is easy, there are two main ways you can work with Github, via command line, or with a desktop GUI. The instructions below will show you how to get started on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Make edits locally in your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make any change you want on your repo. GIT will keep track of it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Use git status to check the working status and synchronization of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having made the changes above and saved them, go back to terminal. Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This checks the current status of changes. If you made changes to any file, GIT will tell you, and if you added a new file, it wil tell you it is not yet tracked. However, these files are not yet staged to be committed to the online repository. In order to commit this files to our online repository, we need to stage them first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Stage our documents for commit\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done working, stage your changes by using:\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add <filename>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "This puts the files into the Git staging area. You can add multiple files to your staging area, so if you edit many files on your machine, when you are done, put them each into the staging area and you can sync them with the online repository all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage our files using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add README.md\n",
    "git add index.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to stage all files, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the result by typing in git status again to see that the changes are ready to be committed. If you ever need to unstage anything, use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git reset HEAD <filename>\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important to note:** files are not staged in their entirety, rather, changes to the files are staged.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Commit our files to our repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are happy with your edits and you have made all your modifications, we are ready to commit the files and update the repository. We start locally. It is best practice to add a comment to your commit that describes the changes you made to the files. For example, for this exercise, we can say we ‘added the hello-world.html document and updated the readme’. This helps others working with your code stay organized and informed on what you did that made this commit worthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To commit our files, we use git commit. We add a –m flag for the message we want to include with our commit. In terminal, still in your working directory and with our files staged, use the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git commit –m “added hello-world.html and updated readme”\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This commits our changes to the repository.  You will see a note that files in your master branch were changed and created.\n",
    " \n",
    "## 5. Synchronize files by pushing them to Github\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step is push the files to the repository on the Github website to synchronize them for the rest of our team and any others that want to work with our files. We do this using git push. The syntax for this is **git push origin branchname**. This will push the file to the remote origin and match it to the name of the branch. If the branch doesn’t exist, it will be created. To push our files to Github, use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git push origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to enter your password to authenticate once more upon hitting enter. This will push our master branch to Github and sync our files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Incorporate changes from Github\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be circumstances where you want to incorporate changes made by others into the repository on your local drive.  In this case, you can log into terminal and use git pull. Git pull will retrieve new work done by other people and merge the local changes with changes made by others. Syntax appears like the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git pull origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on this, read the following at the Github help pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Resolving conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users working in large groups are bound to run into some conflicts when two or more people are working on the same files and changing the same lines of code. There are methods for resolving this, but unfortunately will require some manual checking. In short, conflicts will be flagged in your file when you open it in a text editor. You will have to go through your file and find conflicts, decide which one to accept, and then delete the surrounding conflict markers. This is described in nice detail on the Github help pages at the following address.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/\n",
    "\n",
    "Congrats, this crash course has introduced you to git and Github! Clearly there is much more to learn, including handling issues, which are like tickets individuals can open on your code, then interact with the authors to resolve, and pull requests, where authors can take modified code and merge it into their original projects. See below for additional reading, cheatsheets, and resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Updating files from a forked repo\n",
    "\n",
    "When we fork a repo, first we need to make sure we are getting the updates of the original repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. First we need to add the remote, or **upstream**\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "    2. Second, we need to fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches. This will allow our master branch to keep track of the updated version of the upstream repo.\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    git fetch upstream\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "    3. Next we need to switch to our master branch if we are not on it already:\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    git checkout master\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "    4. Then, we will update or rewrite our master branch so that any commits of yours that aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that other branch:\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    git rebase upstream/master\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "    5. Finally, we wmay need to force the push in order to push it to your own forked repository on GitHub:\n",
    "***\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    git push -f origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to use the -f the first time after you've rebased.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
