#### Part 1 - Website

Create a project homepage on your Github site that you can use to host your project and data visualizations. It is up to you how to structure it. One team member can set up a website in their account for the team and invite others can commit and collaborate.

Also, develop a base level branding (project name, logo, font, and color scheme) for your team and project. Customize your website by changing fonts, colors, and images that go with your project. 

On your website:

1. Include your branding in your design
2. Name of your project team and a short summary of your project
3. Include a copy of your revised mid-term presentation

##### Some suggestions

Use a template like [Bootstrap](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/bootstrap-templates/) in your page customization. The tutorial at this link shows you [how to get started with customizing Bootstrap](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/bootstrap-templates/). You can find free Bootstrap tempates at [http://startbootstrap.com](http://startbootstrap.com/).

#### Part 2 - Data

You must identify and explore the data you intend to use for your project and have it in hand. You should:

1. Please be prepared to present the teaching team with your revised scope of work based on feedback you recieved today.
2. Identify the data you want to use for the project. Obtain that data either through our dropbox folder, amazon server, or scrapping yourself. (A sample would be fine, but we would prefer the whole data set.)
3. Create at least one chart and one map that shows off you data.
