# Data Visualization with D3
## Intro to D3: Make a Chart

For the PSET this week, we are going to create a bar chart using the Health Coverage dataset you used for the county map of the United States in the last PSET.

We would like you to recreate the following bar chart showing healthcare coverage in the 14 counties of Massachusetts. You can use some liberty with your design, but should atleast include the following.

1. The Counties of Massachusetts from the dataset.
2. Show the data in a **Stacked Bar Chart** with the stacks bars of the data representing the percentages with no healthcare and with healthcare. The total height of the bar should be the sum (100%).
3. Display data by making **has healthcare coverage** the color **blue** and **no healthcare coverage** the color **red**.
4. Create a hover over each that shows the percentages when you mouseover.
5. Add source information and a legend.

### Help and Hints

Examples of Stacked Bar Charts can be found at the following. You can borrow code and utilize these examples to help you create your chart.
