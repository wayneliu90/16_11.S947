# Data Visualization with D3
## Intro to D3: Make a Chart

This week, we are going to start digging into D3! Our exercise this week is going to involve creating a bar chart from scratch, illustrating D3 principles on the way.

### Instructions

1. The first thing you will want to do is grab a current copy of the repo from Github. You can simply download the ZIP to make it easy. In here, you will find data and code examples for the exercises.

2. Start up a localhost python server in the directory that contains your examples and data folder. This is where we will do our visualization design and coding.

3. Find the in-class exercise at:

This page will contain the tutorial for the week. We are going to make a bar chart using javascript and D3 methods!
